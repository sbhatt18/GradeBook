# GradeBook
A program created during my spare time, where user can add multiple students to the 'students.txt' file. The program should then be able to read the data from the file using TextI/O and let the user do various things with the data. This program uses many Obj. Oriented features related to Encapsulation such as, Multiple classes, instance variables, private variables, get/set methods, PrintWriter method and takes into account multiple edge cases. 

Things to keep in mind when using Gradebook
-You can modify the numbers but please DONOT add addtional numbers into 'student.txt'as that would be considered as adding additional quizzes, this would essentially break the program.
-Please add,drag/drop the file in the directory where both Java files are. Ex: Shivang/eclipse-workspace/cs1/student.txt , student.txt was added to the cs1 directory because both Java files were located in cs1, inside the src folder/package.
